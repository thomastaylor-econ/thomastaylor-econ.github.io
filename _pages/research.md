Can social media help promote female access to political positions? Using data from 8,814 parliamentary races across 17 sub-Saharan African countries, we explore this question in a context of significant political underrepresentation of women and rising Facebook penetration over the past decade. We leverage the staggered introduction of Facebook's Free Basics--i.e., free access to Facebook through partner mobile operators--across constituencies and time, documenting the success of this connectivity shock and its subsequent effect on female political representation. We find that the availability of Facebook's Free Basics significantly increases the election of female candidates, but only after one electoral cycle. This effect is driven by female candidates endorsed by established political parties and running for the first time. Uncovering the underlying mechanisms, we document a large, positive relationship between social media use and egalitarian gender norms, particularly regarding women in politics. Examining users' online network structures, we show that this association is driven by exposure to diverse and progressive content, and that such online connections are key to Free Basics' electoral impact. Finally, we find that Free Basics' effect is contingent on the presence of fair elections but is amplifed where traditional press freedom is limited </small> <br><br>

Newspapers shape the beliefs and attitudes of citizens, creating room for politicians to extract a large political dividend of controlling the press.  By studying the take-over of one of the most important newspapers in Switzerland (the <i>Bazler Zeitung</i>) in 2010 by a prominent figure of the Swiss right-wing populist party (Swiss People’s Party, SVP), we estimate how politically motivated ownership in the media industry affects preferences towards public policy. By collecting the universe of news articles published in German-speaking Switzerland since 2006 by 7 leading daily newspapers, we show that, following the take-over, the editorial-line of the <i>Bazler Zeitung</i> converged towards the platform of the SVP. This convergence is particularly strong in weeks preceding important electoral events. In addition, we document endogenous responses in content production by the <i>Bazler Zeitung</i>’s competitors. Leveraging Switzerland’s referendum system on public policy issues, we measure alignment with political parties on policy preferences at the municipality level for 145 referendums over the 2002-2023 period. We show that the take-over significantly increased turnout and alignment with the SVP in municipalities where the <i>Bazler Zeitung</i> was circulating prior to it. </small> <br><br>

Abstract:
<small> Can social media promote female access to political positions? Internet and social media
have facilitated a number of evolutions regarding ideas, perceptions and attitudes towards women
and their role in society. This paper focuses on the sub-Saharan African context, where female
political under-representation is particularly salient, and which experienced a rising penetration of
Facebook over the past decade. We build a novel panel dataset at the constituency-election level
and exploit variation in the electoral outcomes observed across 8,162 races occurring in the context
of 63 parliamentary elections in 17 countries. We leverage the staggered introduction of Facebook’s
Free Basics -i.e. free access to Facebook through partner mobile operators- across constituencies
and time, and document the success of this connectivity shock and its subsequent effect on female
political representation. We find that Facebook’s Free Basics significantly fosters the election of female
candidates, but only in the medium-run. This effect is driven by female candidates endorsed by the
established political parties, and running for the first time. Finally, we uncover several mechanisms.
Using survey data, we highlight a political demand mechanism: social media users, and especially
the compliers of the Facebook access shock, have more favorable attitudes towards women and their
presence in politics. Exploring the universe of Facebook posts of candidates, we also document
a political supply mechanism [work in progress]. Preliminary content analysis suggests gendered
differences in online campaigning practices. </small><br><br>

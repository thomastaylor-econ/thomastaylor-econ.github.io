$~~~~~~~$ Can social media help promote female access to political positions? Using data from 8,814 parliamentary races across 17 sub-Saharan African countries, we study this question in a context of persistent underrepresentation of women and rising Facebook penetration. Leveraging the staggered introduction of Facebook's Free Basics, i.e., free access to the platform via partner mobile operators, we find that its introduction significantly increases the election of female candidates, though only after one electoral cycle. The delayed effect reflects a gradual process: initially, male candidates endorsed by parliamentary parties experience declining electoral margins, followed in subsequent elections by greater endorsement and electoral success of female challengers. These dynamics suggest strategic learning by political parties, particularly in supporting first-time female candidates. To uncover mechanisms, we analyze how Free Basics access and social media usage influences political attitudes and social norms. We find that access to Free Basics fosters more egalitarian gender norms, especially regarding women in politics, reflected more strongly in online than offline environments. These changes are not simply a byproduct of broader political dissatisfaction or a generalized demand for political renewal. Importantly, the effect is strongest in contexts where access to Facebook connects users to more diverse online networks with greater female leadership representation. </small> <br><br>

[comment]: <> Newspapers shape the beliefs and attitudes of citizens, creating room for politicians to extract a large political dividend of controlling the press.  By studying the take-over of one of the most important newspapers in Switzerland (the <i>Bazler Zeitung</i>) in 2010 by a prominent figure of the Swiss right-wing populist party (Swiss People’s Party, SVP), we estimate how politically motivated ownership in the media industry affects preferences towards public policy. By collecting the universe of news articles published in German-speaking Switzerland since 2006 by 7 leading daily newspapers, we show that, following the take-over, the editorial-line of the <i>Bazler Zeitung</i> converged towards the platform of the SVP. This convergence is particularly strong in weeks preceding important electoral events. In addition, we document endogenous responses in content production by the <i>Bazler Zeitung</i>’s competitors. Leveraging Switzerland’s referendum system on public policy issues, we measure alignment with political parties on policy preferences at the municipality level for 145 referendums over the 2002-2023 period. We show that the take-over significantly increased turnout and alignment with the SVP in municipalities where the <i>Bazler Zeitung</i> was circulating prior to it. </small> <br><br>

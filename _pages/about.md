Welcome !

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [European University Institute][eui_link], working under the supervision of [Thomas Crossley][crossley_link] and [Alessandro Tarozzi][tarozzi_link]. 

My research interests are primarly in political economy and development economics. You can learn more about my research [here][research_link].

[comment]: <> I am currently visiting the Center for Economic Research on Governance, Inequality and Conflict ([CERGIC][cergic_link]) at ENS Lyon, sponsored by Mathieu Couttenier and Sophie Hatte.

You can reach me at [thomas.taylor@eui.eu](mailto: thomas.taylor@eui.eu).
